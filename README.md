# EZTourney

Web app for MIT Sport Taekwondo to ease the process of tournament registration for tournament coordinators. Athletes register using their MIT email address, admins with their authorized email addresses.

## Software Description

The web app is located [here](https://eztourney.firebaseapp.com/). When a user registers, they will be directed to verify their email. Afterwards, athletes will see a list of athlete pages, admins will see a list of admin pages, and an admin who is also an athlete will see both.
